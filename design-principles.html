        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <ul>

        <p>I think this website shows excellent use of proximity You see the image, and description of the image all together with an enroll now button all in close proximity.  This makes it clear to the user that the image, text and the enroll action are all regarding the same information.  The proper use of proximity makes it clear and easy to understand.  </p>

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <ul>
         <p><a href="https://www.lowes.com">Lowes.com</a></p>
        </ul>

        <p>Alignment is used quite effectively here in the Lowe’s page. The use of bubbles, or circles to organized different categories is clever and clean. Circles while not straight in nature could be difficult to associate with alignment, but they are aligned both horizontally and vertically on the page.  This gives the viewer an overall clean , but organized view of the website and clear navigation to other pages within the website. </p>

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><a href="https://www.sketchers.com">Sketchers.com</a></p>
           </ul>

        <p>Hick’s Law says that with every additional choice increases the time required to take a decision. The use of filters helps us not be distracted by the options available by different brands. On this Sketcher’s website we see good use of filters and Hick’s Law.  They really want you to shop Mother’s Day sales, which is achieved by making the Mother’s day link larger and more front and center than other choice.  They then give you categories to narrow down your search results.  Overall a good use of Hick’s law. </p>
